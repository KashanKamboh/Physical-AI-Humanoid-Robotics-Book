# Module 3: AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)

## Overview

Module 3 introduces students to the AI components that serve as the "brain" of autonomous robotic systems. Using NVIDIA Isaac tools and frameworks, students will implement perception, navigation, and manipulation capabilities that enable robots to understand and interact with their environment intelligently.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this module, students will be able to:

- Set up and configure NVIDIA Isaac Sim for advanced simulation
- Implement autonomous navigation using Nav2
- Create perception pipelines for object detection and recognition
- Integrate AI models with robotic control systems

## Module Structure

This module consists of 3 chapters that progress from simulation to real-world AI integration:

1. **Chapter 8**: Isaac Simulation Pipeline
2. **Chapter 9**: Autonomous Navigation
3. **Chapter 10**: Perception Pipeline

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, students should have:

- Completed Modules 1 and 2 (ROS 2 and simulation)
- Basic understanding of machine learning concepts
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (for Isaac Sim)
- Familiarity with computer vision fundamentals

## Tools and Technologies

This module utilizes:

- **NVIDIA Isaac Sim** (advanced simulation)
- **Isaac ROS** (GPU-accelerated perception)
- **Navigation2 (Nav2)** (path planning and execution)
- **OpenCV** (computer vision processing)
- **TensorRT** (AI model optimization)

## What You Will Be Able to Do at the End

By the end of this module, you will have developed:
- A complete perception pipeline with detection capabilities
- Autonomous navigation system with obstacle avoidance
- AI-enhanced robot control with environmental awareness
- Simulation-to-reality transfer techniques

## Expected Completion Time

- **Estimated Duration**: 3-4 weeks
- **Weekly Commitment**: 6-8 hours
- **Total Effort**: 24-32 hours

## Capstone Connection

The AI-brain capabilities developed in this module form the core intelligence for the VLA (Vision-Language-Action) systems in the final module, enabling sophisticated human-robot interaction.
