# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

## Overview

Module 4 focuses on the integration of vision, language, and action systems that enable natural human-robot interaction. Students will learn to build systems that can understand natural language commands, perceive visual scenes, and execute complex robotic actions in response to human instructions.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this module, students will be able to:

- Integrate speech recognition with robotic action planning
- Implement cognitive task planning for complex behaviors
- Create vision-language systems for scene understanding
- Develop end-to-end voice-commanded robot operation

## Module Structure

This module consists of 3 chapters that build toward the final capstone system:

1. **Chapter 11**: Voice-to-Action Agents
2. **Chapter 12**: Cognitive Task Planning
3. **Chapter 13**: Capstone Execution

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, students should have:

- Completed all previous modules (ROS 2, simulation, AI-brain)
- Understanding of natural language processing concepts
- Experience with multimodal AI systems
- Completed perception and navigation from Module 3

## Tools and Technologies

This module utilizes:

- **OpenAI Whisper** (speech recognition)
- **Large Language Models** (GPT or open-source alternatives)
- **ROS 2** (action execution)
- **Computer Vision libraries** (scene understanding)
- **Task planning frameworks** (behavior trees or PDDL)

## What You Will Be Able to Do at the End

By the end of this module, you will have built a complete VLA system that:
- Responds to natural language commands
- Perceives and understands visual scenes
- Plans and executes complex robotic tasks
- Integrates all previous module capabilities

## Expected Completion Time

- **Estimated Duration**: 3-4 weeks
- **Weekly Commitment**: 6-8 hours
- **Total Effort**: 24-32 hours

## Capstone Connection

This module culminates in the complete capstone project where all system components work together to execute the "Autonomous Humanoid" scenario: VOICE ⟶ PLAN ⟶ NAVIGATE ⟶ RECOGNIZE OBJECT ⟶ MANIPULATE.
