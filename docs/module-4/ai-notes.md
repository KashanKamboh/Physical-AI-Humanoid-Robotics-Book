## Common Student Questions (AI-Predicted)

**Q: Why doesn't my robot understand my voice commands?**
A: Common causes include speech recognition errors, language model limitations, mismatch between command and robot capabilities, or ambiguous command phrasing.

**Q: How do I handle commands that are too complex for my robot?**
A: Break down complex commands into simpler subtasks, implement command clarification dialogues, or provide feedback about robot limitations.

**Q: What's the difference between VLA systems and traditional robotics?**
A: VLA systems integrate perception, language understanding, and action in a unified framework, enabling natural human-robot interaction, while traditional robotics often requires pre-programmed behaviors or teleoperation.
