# Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Overview

Module 2 focuses on creating and working with digital twins - virtual replicas of physical robotic systems. Students will learn to develop physics-based simulations using Gazebo and Unity, enabling safe testing and validation of robotic algorithms before deployment on real hardware.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this module, students will be able to:

- Set up and configure Gazebo simulation environments
- Create realistic physics models for robotic systems
- Implement sensor simulation with proper noise models
- Utilize Unity for advanced humanoid rigging and animation

## Module Structure

This module consists of 3 chapters that build from basic simulation setup to advanced physics modeling:

1. **Chapter 5**: Setting Up Gazebo
2. **Chapter 6**: Sensors Simulation
3. **Chapter 7**: Unity for Robotics

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, students should have:

- Completed Module 1 (ROS 2 fundamentals)
- Basic understanding of physics concepts (kinematics, dynamics)
- Familiarity with 3D modeling concepts
- ROS 2 workspace with simulation packages installed

## Tools and Technologies

This module utilizes:

- **Gazebo Garden** (physics simulation)
- **Unity 2022.3 LTS** (advanced visualization)
- **ROS 2 Gazebo plugins** (integration)
- **RViz2** (visualization coordination)

## What You Will Be Able to Do at the End

By the end of this module, you will have created:
- A complete simulation world with physics properties
- Realistic sensor models with noise characteristics
- Unity-based humanoid animation system
- ROS-bridged simulation environment

## Expected Completion Time

- **Estimated Duration**: 3-4 weeks
- **Weekly Commitment**: 6-8 hours
- **Total Effort**: 24-32 hours

## Capstone Connection

The simulation skills developed in this module are essential for safe testing of the AI-brain and VLA systems in later modules, allowing for rapid iteration without hardware risk.
