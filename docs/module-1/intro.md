# Module 1: Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Overview

Module 1 introduces students to the Robot Operating System (ROS 2), the middleware framework that serves as the "nervous system" for robotic applications. Students will learn how to design, build, and manage distributed robotic systems using ROS 2's communication patterns and tools.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this module, students will be able to:

- Build ROS 2 packages and manage workspaces
- Create nodes that publish and subscribe to topics
- Connect Python programs to ROS controllers
- Understand robot URDF structures and their role in robotic systems

## Module Structure

This module consists of 4 chapters that progressively build from basic ROS concepts to complex system integration:

1. **Chapter 1**: Introduction to ROS 2 Architecture
2. **Chapter 2**: Writing Nodes with rclpy
3. **Chapter 3**: URDF for Humanoids
4. **Chapter 4**: Integrating Python Agents

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, students should have:

- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of Linux command line
- Familiarity with version control (Git)
- Completed software installation from the setup guide

## Tools and Technologies

This module utilizes:

- **ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill** (primary framework)
- **rclpy** (Python client library)
- **RViz2** (visualization tool)
- **Launch files** (system orchestration)

## What You Will Be Able to Do at the End

By the end of this module, you will have built a complete ROS 2 system that demonstrates:
- Multiple communicating nodes
- Sensor data publishing
- Command subscription and execution
- Robot model visualization

## Expected Completion Time

- **Estimated Duration**: 3-4 weeks
- **Weekly Commitment**: 6-8 hours
- **Total Effort**: 24-32 hours

## Capstone Connection

Skills learned in this module form the foundation for all subsequent modules, as ROS 2 communication patterns are used throughout the course to connect perception, planning, and control systems.
