# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — Teaching Textbook

This repository contains a comprehensive Docusaurus-based textbook on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics, designed to teach students and professionals the complete pipeline from robotic fundamentals to advanced Vision-Language-Action systems.

## 📚 Book Structure

The textbook is organized into 4 comprehensive modules:

### Module 1: Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
- **Chapter 1**: Introduction to ROS 2 Architecture
- **Chapter 2**: Writing Nodes with rclpy
- **Chapter 3**: URDF for Humanoids
- **Chapter 4**: Integrating Python Agents

### Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
- **Chapter 5**: Setting Up Gazebo
- **Chapter 6**: Sensors Simulation
- **Chapter 7**: Unity for Robotics

### Module 3: AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)
