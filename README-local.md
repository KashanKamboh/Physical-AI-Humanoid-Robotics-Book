# Hackathon Project 1: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book

This project contains a comprehensive Docusaurus-based textbook on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. The book teaches students and professionals the complete pipeline from robotic fundamentals to advanced Vision-Language-Action systems.

## 📚 Project Overview

The "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — Teaching Textbook" is a complete educational resource that covers:

- **Module 1**: Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
- **Module 2**: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
- **Module 3**: AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)
- **Module 4**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

## 🎯 Main Deliverable

The main content is located in the `Homanoid-Robotics-Book` directory, which contains a fully functional Docusaurus website with:

- Complete textbook content across 4 modules and 13 chapters
- Capstone project implementing VOICE ⟶ PLAN ⟶ NAVIGATE ⟶ RECOGNIZE OBJECT ⟶ MANIPULATE pipeline
- Reference materials including glossary, technical standards, and bibliography
- AI-generated notes and research source registers
- Instructor guides and course roadmap

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Docusaurus**: Static site generation for educational content
- **ROS 2**: Robotic Operating System for communication and control
- **Gazebo**: Physics simulation for robotics
- **Unity**: Visualization and interaction for robotics
- **NVIDIA Isaac**: GPU-accelerated perception and simulation
- **Python**: AI agent integration and scripting

## 📖 Key Features

- Complete curriculum from basic ROS concepts to advanced VLA systems
- Hands-on code examples with verification procedures
- Integration of multiple robotics frameworks and tools
- Capstone project demonstrating autonomous humanoid capabilities
- Comprehensive reference materials and research sources

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Navigate to the `Homanoid-Robotics-Book` directory
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Start development server: `npm start` or `yarn start`
4. Access the textbook at `http://localhost:3000`

## 🤖 Project Goals

This project demonstrates the implementation of a complete Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics curriculum that bridges theoretical knowledge with practical implementation, preparing students for advanced work in robotics and AI integration.
