## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive task list for the Book Implementation Plan with:

- Phase 1: Setup tasks for repository structure and Docusaurus initialization
- Phase 2: Foundational tasks for site configuration and validation systems
- Phase 3: User Story 1 tasks for complete book implementation pipeline
- Phase 4: User Story 2 tasks for research and writing integration
- Phase 5: User Story 3 tasks for module development and validation
- Phase 6: Polish tasks for final compilation and validation

All tasks follow the required format with checkboxes, IDs, parallel markers, and story labels where appropriate. Tasks are organized by priority (P1, P2, P3) and include specific file paths for implementation.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete task breakdown for book implementation with 46 specific tasks
- 🧪 Tests: null
- 📁 Files: specs/001-book-implementation/tasks.md, specs/001-book-implementation/plan.md, specs/001-book-implementation/spec.md
